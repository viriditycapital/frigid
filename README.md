Wine fridges are pretty popular, but it's surprisingly hard to find a wine fridge that is affordable, even though they are pretty much the same as a normal fridge, except with more precise (?) temperature control, and usually flashier displays.

A lot of wine fridges also lack basic convenience for consumers. Easily slideable rows, large enough rows, bluetooth or wifi inventory, automatic wine label recognition, humidity control, vibration mitigation etc. It seems like the wine fridge manufacturers are just creating clones of the same mediocre model, and pushing it out to consumers.

Can we do better? I think so, but it will be a large effort to start from scratch, and figure out how to get suppliers. Designing the hardware itself will also take some time as well, although lts of work can be just taken from refrigerator parts.

We can also have the wine fridge double as a normal fridge...
